# # solving the equation x2+xâˆ’1=0
# assigning values to variables
a <- 1
b <- 1
c <- -1

# solving the quadratic equation
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c) ) / ( 2*a )


# # # SECTION 1.3: DATA TYPES

# loading the dslabs package and the murders dataset
library(dslabs)
data(murders)

# determining that the murders dataset is of the "data frame" class
class(murders)
# finding out more about the structure of the object
str(murders)
# showing the first 6 lines of the dataset
head(murders)

# using the accessor operator to obtain the population column
murders$population
# displaying the variable names in the murders dataset
names(murders)
# determining how many entries are in a vector
pop <- murders$population
length(pop)
# vectors can be of class numeric and character
class(pop)
class(murders$state)

# logical vectors are either TRUE or FALSE
z <- 3 == 2
z
class(z)

# factors are another type of class
class(murders$region)
# obtaining the levels of a factor
levels(murders$region)
