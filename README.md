# Harvardx Data Science Professional Certificate


This repository includes my course notes, assessments, and resources from [*Module 1: R Basics*](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-r-basics) of the 17-month-long [Harvardx Professional Certificate Program in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science).

## Module 1: Data Science - R Basics

### Section Overview:

1. **R Basics, Functions, Data types:** Getting started with R, functions, data types

2. **Vectors, Sorting:** Operating on vectors and advanced functions such as sorting

3. **Indexing, Data Manipulation, Plots:** Wrangling and visualizing data

4. **Programming Basics:** Using general programming features like ‘if-else,’ and ‘for loop’ commands, and writing own functions to perform various operations on datasets

### What I Learned:
