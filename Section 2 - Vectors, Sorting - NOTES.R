# # # SECTION 2.1: VECTORS

# We may create vectors of class numeric or character with the concatenate function
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy", "canada", "egypt")

# We can also name the elements of a numeric vector
# Note that the two lines of code below have the same result
codes <- c(italy = 380, canada = 124, egypt = 818)
codes <- c("italy" = 380, "canada" = 124, "egypt" = 818)

# We can also name the elements of a numeric vector using the names() function
codes <- c(380, 124, 818)
country <- c("italy","canada","egypt")
names(codes) <- country

# Using square brackets is useful for subsetting to access specific elements of a vector
codes[2]
codes[c(1,3)]
codes[1:2]

# If the entries of a vector are named, they may be accessed by referring to their name
codes["canada"]
codes[c("egypt","italy")]


# # # SECTION 2.2: SORTING



# # # SECTION 2.3: VECTOR ARITHMETIC

# The name of the state with the maximum population is found by doing the following
murders$state[which.max(murders$population)]

# how to obtain the murder rate
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000

# ordering the states by murder rate, in decreasing order
murders$state[order(murder_rate, decreasing=TRUE)]
